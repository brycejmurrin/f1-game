/* test-bg-outcome.test.mjs — a background run's verdict never reads green when

 *
 * test-bg.mjs reads a run's outcome out of its own log. A group can be two
 * commands (`test:tooling` is tooling-fast && sweeps; a twinned group runs its
 * VM twins, then Playwright), and until 2026-09-24 the FIRST half's
 * `= run passed` or `# fail 0` beat the `= bg exit N` trailer, so a red second
 * half — or a Playwright half killed before its summary — read as passed and
 * `--wait` exited 0.
 *
 * Run: node --test tests/unit/test-bg-outcome.test.mjs
