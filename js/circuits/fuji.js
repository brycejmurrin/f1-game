/* Apex 26 — FUJI circuit definition (data only). Retired circuit (`classic: true`).
   Japanese GP 2007-2008. Mount Fuji to the north; the 1.475 km pit straight is the longest in the set.

   Centreline: OpenStreetMap (ODbL-1.0), stitched by tools/track/stitch-osm-ring.mjs
   and projected by tools/track/import-circuit-path.mjs. The bacinger/f1-circuits
   file the other 40 circuits come from carries exactly 40 features and the game
   already had all of them, so this one had to be recovered from OSM directly —
   tools/track/osm-circuits.json holds the bbox and the researched lap length,
   and re-running the stitch reproduces this trace.
   Stitched 4563 m researched vs 4554 m projected (-0.20%). */
