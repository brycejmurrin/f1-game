   LAZY_SCENERY (tools/manifest.cjs): no <script> tag.

   Brief: docs/tracks/brands_hatch.md. Every §4 row is implemented; the block
   that carries each one is named below.

     1. THE BOWL .............. rows 0.025/-1, 0.076/-1, 0.190/-1, 0.378/-1,
                               0.832/-1, 0.914/-1  (open grass banking, chalk,
                               and the spectator country BEHIND the banking)
     2. BRABHAM FRONTAGE ...... rows 0.005/-1, 0.014/-1  (main stand, retail
                               row, Paddock Hill Grandstand on the lip, and the
                               entrance / car park country behind the frontage)
     3. THE INFIELD ........... rows 0.005/+1, 0.014/+1, 0.040/+1, 0.260/+1,
                               0.960/+1  (pits, Kentagon, paddock, Cooper
                               Straight, race control + start gantry)
     4. DRUIDS ................ rows 0.076/-1, 0.070/+1  (terracing + footbridge)
     5. THE WOODS ............. rows 0.378/-1, 0.430/-1, 0.461/+1, 0.532/-1,
                               0.636/+1, 0.760/-1  (Surtees -> Stirlings)
     6. FURNITURE ............. armco, catch fence, tyre walls, marshal posts,
                               cameras, hoardings — all rows
     7. KENT BACKDROP ......... §1/§2 downland beyond the circuit

   The two worlds are kept apart on purpose: WOODS_A (0.378) .. WOODS_B (0.845)
   is closed-in broadleaf with nothing built; everything outside it is the open
   bowl with spectators on grass. That contrast IS Brands Hatch (§6).

   DEPTH RULE: the bowl reads from every seat (§6), so the -1 side is built in
   four bands — banking (0..30 m), rim furniture (30..55 m), spectator car
   parks (75..120 m), boundary tree belt (125..200 m). Inside the woods those
   bands collapse to trees only. Everything past 40 m is anchor()-tested with
   onTrack() before it is emitted, because the bowl is tight enough that a
   far set-back on one corner lands on the far side of the loop. */
