/* Apex 26 — CIRCUIT LORE: the thing about each circuit a broadcast would say. */
"use strict";
// WHY A TABLE, when js/audio/announcer.js opens by arguing against one.
//
// That argument still holds for NUMBERS. Length, corner count, elevation and
// the lights are derived from the def and the built track precisely so nothing
// can fall out of step with the circuit it describes — a hand-typed "5.8
// kilometres" survives a geometry change and a derived one cannot.
//
// It does not hold for CHARACTER. No measurement yields "Eau Rouge", "the
// Temple of Speed" or "thin air at two thousand metres", and a welcome built
// only from numbers says the same shape of thing about fifty-two circuits: a
// length, a corner count, a density band. That is what this file is for, and
// the two halves stay in their own lanes — every line here is a fact about the
// PLACE that does not change when the geometry is re-surveyed.
//
// THE FAILURE THE HEADER WARNED ABOUT is "written for the six somebody
// bothered and missing on the rest". tests/unit/announcer.test.mjs asserts the
// keys here are exactly the circuit ids in the manifest, both ways, so a new
// circuit cannot ship without its line and a retired one cannot leave a
// dangling entry.
//
// SLOTS. `line` is the identity and is required. `corner` names the piece of
// road the circuit is known for. `wet` and `night` are spoken only when the
// conditions call for them, which is what keeps a wet Spa and a dry Spa from
// being the same read. Every value is ONE spoken sentence, ending in its own
// punctuation: js/audio/announcer.js speaks one utterance per line, so a
// sentence here is a unit of phrasing, not a paragraph to be re-cut.
//
// WRITING RULES, enforced by the test: no ALL-CAPS tokens (RadioVoice
// speakable() spells short ones out letter by letter), no "GP" (say Grand
// Prix), and nothing that restates a number the script already derives.
