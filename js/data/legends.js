/* Apex 26 — LEGENDS: twelve historic drivers, their record, a tribute livery
 * and the period car each of them raced.
 *
 * WHAT IS FACT AND WHAT IS THE GAME'S OPINION — the split this file exists to keep.
 *
 *   `record`  is FACT, sourced (see SOURCES below): starts, wins, poles,
 *             podiums, titles, years. Nothing here is estimated. If a number is
 *             wrong, fix it against the source; do not tune it to taste.
 *   `ratings` is DERIVED from that record by ratingsFor(), a documented formula.
 *             Nobody hand-picks a legend's pace. Change the formula and every
 *             driver moves together, which is the point: the ranking is an
 *             argument from the record, not a favourite.
 *   `livery`  is a TRIBUTE PALETTE, not a replica. Where a source states the
 *             colour it is used (Clark's British Racing Green, Stewart's French
 *             Racing Blue, the bare-alloy Silver Arrow); where it does not, the
 *             palette evokes the era and is NOT claimed to match a real car, and
 *             no sponsor mark is reproduced.
 *
 * THE ERA CAVEAT, stated because the numbers cannot state it. Rates favour the
 * small fields and short seasons of the 1950s: Fangio started 51 races against
 * Schumacher's 306, so his 57% pole rate is a thinner sample AND a weaker field.
 * The formula does not correct for this — no honest correction exists — so read
 * these as "dominance within his own era", never as a cross-era time sheet.
 *
 * NATIONAL COLOURS, where a tribute leans on one: Britain green (British
 * Racing Green, #004225), Italy red (rosso corsa, #E4002B), France blue (Bleu
 * de France), Germany white or bare metal. The Silver Arrow is bare metal for a
 * reason worth keeping: Mercedes stripped the white paint at the 1934 Eifel
 * Race to make the weight limit, and the exposed metal named the cars. Senna's
 * yellow accent is Brazil's racing colour (pale yellow with green), Fangio's
 * is Argentina's (blue with a yellow bonnet) — both national, neither a team.
 *
 * SOURCES (fetched 2026-09-16, en.wikipedia.org): the per-driver articles for
 * Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark, Niki Lauda,
 * Alain Prost, Jackie Stewart and Nigel Mansell, plus "List of Formula One
 * World Drivers' Champions", plus "British racing green", "Rosso corsa",
 * "List of international auto racing colours" and "Silver Arrows" for the
 * palettes. Clark's podium count is from statsf1.com, which the infobox omits.

   * 23 cars whenever MY TEAM was selected, against 22 painted grid boxes —
   * so the ceiling the claim leaned on was being exceeded by the shipped game.
   * The lesson is the one this file is otherwise built around: a constraint
   * asserted from memory is not a measurement.
   *
   * What IS real: the painted grid has to be as long as the field, which is now
   * plumbed (js/game.js fieldSize -> Tracks.build opts.gridSlots), and the team
   * grids ONE car — the legend the driver picker has selected.
   *
   * SETTINGS, derived — the four garage stats come from the same five axes as
   * the ratings, so a legend's car matches the driver rather than being typed
   * in twice:
   *   speed      pace, the axis that already means one fast lap
   *   accel      pace and craft: getting the lap STARTED well
   *   cornering  craft and awareness — the two that make a car work in traffic
   *   braking    consistency, the axis that says the lap repeats
   * The team tier (0 fastest) follows the headline of those axes, so a legend

       * CORRECTION. This said the game had "eight hand-drawn vector crests and
       * no others", wrong twice. The eight in js/car/crest-paths.js are TRACED
       * from bitmaps, not hand-drawn — and they are not all of them: mercedes,
       * haas and audi keep GEOMETRIC constructions in js/car/liverytex.js
       * (MARK_PARTS), because a ring and a three-point star are exact as maths
       * and only approximate as a trace. Eleven marks exist, not eight. The
       * error was reading one file and generalising, and it cost Fangio his
       * Silver Arrow badge for a deploy.
       *
       * Four still wear none, and that is a SOURCE problem, not an oversight:
       * Lotus (Clark, Hill), Tyrrell (Stewart) and Vanwall (Moss) are
       * TYPOGRAPHIC marks — a roundel with script, a wordmark — and
       * tools/car/trace-logo.mjs is explicit that memory is the wrong source
       * (hand-drawing Red Bull from memory produced "a pair of pigs"). A
       * geometric badge can be constructed; a wordmark cannot be remembered,
       * and a wrong crest is worse than none. */

   *   aero "minimal"    lvl 0 — no wings at all, which is the whole 1950s car
   *   cockpit "standard" halo 0 — an open cockpit, mandatory before 2018
   *   floor "stripped"  fences 0 — a flat bottom with no aero furniture
   *   wheels "spoked"   6 spokes — wire wheels; "open_spoke" is the 8-spoke
   *                     magnesium that replaced them
   *   exhaust "megaphone" one flared pipe — the period megaphone
   *   suspension "comfort" tall and soft with push 0 — no pushrods yet
   * Later eras walk the same knobs FORWARD, so the twelve legends span nine
   * visibly different cars using parts a player can already fit themselves.

   * McLaren's is 2000 — but those are never written to a garage sheet, and this

   * downgraded something. The budget is therefore spent on the SILHOUETTE
